Alright, This is banana bread for dummies

Ingredients

1. One banana
2. One loaf of bread
3. One pair of hands

Instructions

1. Take the loaf of bread and rip a nice bite sized chunk out of it.
Its helpful if you take the loaf of bread with two hands, and then
use one hand to rip off the bite sized chunk. Careful now, I often
get excited and rip off a chunk that is way too large for my face.
If this happens to you, just tear that chunk in two, and contemplate
why you're such a dissapointment.

2. Take that banana between both of your beefy hands and just rip a 
good bite sized chunk off of that. Don't get excited and rip too much
off that banana.

3. Put that banana on that bread and place the two items in your mouth.

4. You got banana bread you dingus.
